/* Write a program for a matchstick game being played between the computer and a user. Your program should ensure that the computer always wins. Rules for the game are as follows:
--  There are 21 matchsticks.
--  The compiler asks the player to pick 1,2,3, or 4 matchsticks.
--  After the person picks, the computer does its picking.
--  Whoever is forced to pick up the last matchsticks loses the game. */
